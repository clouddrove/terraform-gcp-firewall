We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-gcp-firewall/releases).


Here are some examples of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
### Default subnet
```hcl
module "firewall" {

source = "clouddrove/firewall/google"
version     = "1.0.0"

name                            = "test-firewall"
module_enabled                  = true
google_compute_firewall_enabled = true
project_id                      = var.gcp_project_id
network                         = module.vpc.vpc_id
description                     = "Creates firewall rule targeting tagged instances."
protocol                        = "TCP"
ports                           = ["80", "4440", "443", "22"]
source_ranges                   = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

}
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| allow | (Optional) The list of ALLOW rules specified by this firewall. Each rule specifies a protocol and port-range tuple that describes a permitted connection. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| description | Creates Firewall rule targetting tagged instances | `string` | `"Managed by clouddrove"` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| google\_compute\_firewall\_enabled | n/a | `bool` | `true` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. sequence of application name and environment `name`,`environment`,'attribute' [`webserver`,`qa`,`devops`,`public`,] . | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| module\_enabled | n/a | `bool` | `true` | no |
| name | Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. | `string` | `""` | no |
| network | The name or self\_link of the network to attach this firewall to. | `string` | `""` | no |
| ports | n/a | `list(number)` | `[]` | no |
| project\_id | The project in which the resource belongs. If it is not provided, the provider project is used. | `string` | `""` | no |
| protocol | The IP protocol to which this rule applies. The protocol type is required when creating a firewall rule. | `string` | `""` | no |
| source\_ranges | IP que será liberado para acessar | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  "0.0.0.0/0"<br>]</pre> | no |
| source\_tags | Nomes de tags que serão utilizadas para utilizar com esta regra de firewall | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| id | Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. |
| name | an identifier for the resource with format |
| self\_link | The URI of the created resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
